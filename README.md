# Introduction
Optical flow dataset used in 
*"Accurate Detection of Abnormal State in Ant Colony from Transient Behavioral Observations"*
*Taeyeong Choi, Benjamin Pyenson, J Ìˆuergen Liebig, Theodore P. Pavlic*
(Submitted to IAAI-21)

Optical flows were extracted every >2 minutes from 20-day video recording of a colony of >50 Harpegnathos saltator ants.
First 2-day data were labelled as "stable" class while the rest were as "unstable" to build an One-class classifier that can 
detect abnormal behaviors although it is trained only with normal ones.  

# Brief Backgrounds on *H. saltator*


# Main Configurations for recording

1. A colony of 54 Harpegnathos saltator was recorded for 20 days by an overhead camera in a lab setting. 
1. After Day 2, the whole colony was manipulated to be unstable by removing all recognized egg layers. 
1. A social tournament was observed to be initiated involving intensive, aggressive interactions among ants. 
1. Only little antagonistic actions were found on the last several days.
